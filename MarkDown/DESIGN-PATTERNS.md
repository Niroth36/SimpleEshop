## Currently Implemented Patterns

### 1. Retry Pattern

**Status: ✅ Implemented**

**What is it?**  
The Retry pattern is a resilience pattern that enables an application to handle transient failures by automatically retrying a failed operation. This pattern is particularly useful for operations that interact with remote resources like databases, APIs, or other services that might experience temporary unavailability.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Transient Failures**: Temporary issues that resolve themselves (network glitches, temporary service unavailability)
- **Retry Strategies**: Fixed interval, incremental interval, or exponential backoff
- **Maximum Retries**: Limiting the number of retry attempts to avoid infinite loops
- **Backoff Periods**: Increasing delay between retries to reduce system load

**Implementation in SimpleEshop:**  
The Retry pattern is implemented in several places:

- **Database Connection**: In `server_postgresql.js`, the `connectWithRetry()` function implements a retry mechanism for database connections with a fixed backoff strategy:
  ```javascript
  async function connectWithRetry() {
      const maxRetries = 5;
      let retries = 0;
      while (retries < maxRetries) {
          try {
              const client = await pool.connect();
              console.log('Connected to PostgreSQL!');
              client.release();
              return;
          } catch (err) {
              retries++;
              console.log(`Database connection attempt ${retries}/${maxRetries} failed. Retrying in 5 seconds...`);
              console.error('Connection error:', err.message);

              if (retries === maxRetries) {
                  console.error('Max retries reached. Could not connect to database.');
                  process.exit(1);
              }

              await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 5000));
          }
      }
  }
  ```

- **MinIO Connection**: In both email services (`welcome-email/index.js` and `order-confirmation-email/index.js`), there are retry mechanisms for setting up MinIO bucket notifications and waiting for MinIO to be ready:
  ```javascript
  function waitForMinIO() {
      minioClient.listBuckets()
          .then(() => {
              console.log("MinIO is ready");
              setupBucketNotification();
          })
          .catch(error => {
              console.error("MinIO not ready yet:", error);
              setTimeout(waitForMinIO, 5000);
          });
  }
  ```

- **Bucket Notification Setup**: The email services also implement retry logic for setting up bucket notifications:
  ```javascript
  async function setupBucketNotification() {
      try {
          // Setup code...
      } catch (error) {
          console.error("Error setting up bucket notification:", error);
          // Retry after a delay
          setTimeout(setupBucketNotification, 5000);
      }
  }
  ```

**Benefits:**
1. **Improved Reliability**: Automatically recovers from transient failures
2. **Resilience**: Makes the application more robust against network issues
3. **Self-Healing**: Reduces the need for manual intervention
4. **Graceful Degradation**: Provides a better user experience during temporary issues

**Drawbacks:**
1. **Increased Complexity**: Adds complexity to the codebase
2. **Resource Consumption**: Failed operations consume resources
3. **Delayed Failure Reporting**: Users may wait longer before receiving an error

**Real-World Scenarios:**
- Database connections during application startup
- API calls to external services
- Network operations in distributed systems
- Cloud resource provisioning

### 2. Event-Driven Architecture

**Status: ✅ Implemented**

**What is it?**  
Event-Driven Architecture (EDA) is an architectural pattern where components communicate through events. In this pattern, when a component performs an action or encounters a significant change in state, it publishes an event. Other components that are interested in that event can subscribe to it and react accordingly.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Events**: Messages that indicate something has happened
- **Publishers**: Components that generate events
- **Subscribers**: Components that receive and process events
- **Event Channels**: Mechanisms for transmitting events (message queues, streams)
- **Decoupling**: Publishers don't know which subscribers (if any) will process their events

**Implementation in SimpleEshop:**  
The application uses an event-driven architecture for several operations:

- **User Registration Events**: When a user registers, their data is stored in a MinIO bucket, which triggers an event:
  ```javascript
  // In server_postgresql.js
  app.post('/api/register', async (req, res) => {
      // Registration logic...

      // Store user data in MinIO for triggering welcome email
      try {
          const userDataJson = JSON.stringify({
              userId: userId,
              username: username,
              email: email,
              registrationDate: new Date().toISOString()
          });

          const bucketName = 'user-registrations';
          const objectName = `user-${userId}-${Date.now()}.json`;

          await minioClient.putObject(bucketName, objectName, userDataJson);
          console.log(`User data stored in MinIO: ${objectName}`);

          // Log that we would send a welcome email
          await sendWelcomeEmail(username, email);
      } catch (minioErr) {
          console.error('Error storing user data in MinIO:', minioErr);
          // Continue with registration even if MinIO storage fails
      }
  });
  ```

- **Email Services**: Both the welcome-email and order-confirmation-email services listen for events (object creation in MinIO buckets) to trigger their operations:
  ```javascript
  // In welcome-email/index.js
  const listener = minioClient.listenBucketNotification("user-registrations", "", "", ["s3:ObjectCreated:*"]);
  listener.on("notification", async notification => {
      console.log("Received notification:", notification);
      await processUserRegistration(notification);
  });
  ```

- **Event Processing**: The email services process the events and perform actions based on the event data:
  ```javascript
  async function processUserRegistration(notification) {
      try {
          console.log(`Processing event: ${notification.eventName} for ${notification.s3.object.key}`);

          // Only process object creation events
          if (notification.eventName !== "s3:ObjectCreated:Put" && notification.eventName !== "s3:ObjectCreated:Post") {
              return;
          }

          const bucketName = notification.s3.bucket.name;
          const objectName = notification.s3.object.key;

          // Get the object data
          const dataStream = await minioClient.getObject(bucketName, objectName);

          // Process the data and send email...
      } catch (error) {
          console.error("Error processing notification:", error);
      }
  }
  ```

**Benefits:**
1. **Loose Coupling**: Components don't need direct knowledge of each other
2. **Scalability**: Easy to add new subscribers without modifying publishers
3. **Flexibility**: Components can evolve independently
4. **Responsiveness**: Events can be processed asynchronously
5. **Resilience**: Failure in one component doesn't necessarily affect others

**Drawbacks:**
1. **Eventual Consistency**: May lead to temporary inconsistencies
2. **Complexity**: Can be harder to understand the flow of the application
3. **Debugging Challenges**: Tracing event flows can be difficult
4. **Event Schema Evolution**: Changing event formats requires careful coordination

**Real-World Scenarios:**
- User registration triggering welcome emails
- Order placement triggering confirmation emails and inventory updates
- User activity triggering analytics events
- System monitoring and alerting

### 3. Stateless Services

**Status: ✅ Implemented**

**What is it?**  
Stateless Services is an architectural pattern where services don't maintain client state between requests. Each request contains all the information needed to process it, and the service doesn't rely on stored context from previous interactions.

**Key Concepts:**
- **No Session State**: Services don't store client-specific data between requests
- **Self-Contained Requests**: Each request includes all necessary information
- **Horizontal Scalability**: Services can be easily replicated and load-balanced
- **Resilience**: No single point of failure for state storage

**Implementation in SimpleEshop:**  
The email services are designed as stateless microservices:

- **Welcome Email Service**: Processes each notification independently without maintaining state:
  ```javascript
  // In welcome-email/index.js
  listener.on("notification", async notification => {
      console.log("Received notification:", notification);
      await processUserRegistration(notification);
  });
  ```

- **Order Confirmation Email Service**: Similarly processes each order notification independently:
  ```javascript
  // In order-confirmation-email/index.js
  listener.on("notification", async notification => {
      console.log("Received notification:", notification);
      await processOrderConfirmation(notification);
  });
  ```

- **HTTP Server**: The HTTP servers in both services handle each request independently:
  ```javascript
  const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
      // Health check endpoint
      if (req.method === 'GET') {
          res.writeHead(200, { "Content-Type": "text/plain" });
          res.end("Welcome Email Service is running");
          return;
      }

      // Handle webhook notifications from MinIO
      if (req.method === 'POST') {
          // Process each request independently...
      }
  });
  ```

**Benefits:**
1. **Horizontal Scalability**: Services can be easily scaled by adding more instances
2. **Resilience**: No single point of failure for state storage
3. **Simplicity**: Easier to reason about service behavior
4. **Load Balancing**: Requests can be routed to any service instance
5. **Deployment Flexibility**: Services can be deployed, updated, or replaced independently

**Drawbacks:**
1. **Repeated Information**: Requests may contain redundant information
2. **External State Storage**: When state is needed, it must be stored externally
3. **Potential Performance Impact**: May require additional database queries

**Real-World Scenarios:**
- Email processing services
- API gateways
- Content delivery services
- Authentication services

### 4. Async Processing

**Status: ✅ Implemented**

**What is it?**  
Async Processing is a pattern where operations that might take time to complete are executed asynchronously, allowing the program to continue execution without waiting for the operation to finish. This pattern is particularly useful for I/O-bound operations like network requests, file operations, and database queries.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Non-Blocking Operations**: Operations don't block the execution thread
- **Promises/Callbacks**: Mechanisms for handling operation completion
- **Event Loop**: Manages asynchronous operations
- **Concurrency**: Multiple operations can be in progress simultaneously

**Implementation in SimpleEshop:**  
The application uses asynchronous processing in numerous places:

- **Database Operations**: Database queries use async/await for non-blocking I/O:
  ```javascript
  // In server_postgresql.js
  app.post('/api/register', async (req, res) => {
      const { username, email, password } = req.body;

      try {
          const hash = await bcrypt.hash(password, 10);
          const query = 'INSERT INTO users (username, email, password) VALUES ($1, $2, $3) RETURNING id';
          const result = await pool.query(query, [username, email, hash]);
          const userId = result.rows[0].id;

          // More async operations...
      } catch (err) {
          console.error(err);
          res.status(500).send('Server error');
      }
  });
  ```

- **Email Services**: Both email services use async/await and event listeners for asynchronous operations:
  ```javascript
  // In welcome-email/index.js
  dataStream.on("end", async () => {
      try {
          // Parse the user data
          const userDataObj = JSON.parse(userData);
          console.log("User data:", userDataObj);

          // Call the handler function
          const result = await handler({ body: userDataObj }, {});
          console.log("Handler result:", result);
      } catch (error) {
          console.error("Error processing user data:", error);
      }
  });
  ```

- **MinIO Operations**: Object storage operations are handled asynchronously:
  ```javascript
  // In server_postgresql.js
  await minioClient.putObject(bucketName, objectName, userDataJson);
  ```

- **Circuit Breaker**: The circuit breaker implementation uses async/await:
  ```javascript
  // In circuit-breaker.js
  async fire(...args) {
      // Check if circuit is OPEN
      if (this.state === 'OPEN') {
          // Circuit logic...
      }

      try {
          const result = await this.fn(...args);
          this.success();
          return result;
      } catch (error) {
          this.failure(error);
          throw error;
      }
  }
  ```

**Benefits:**
1. **Improved Responsiveness**: The application remains responsive during time-consuming operations
2. **Better Resource Utilization**: CPU can process other tasks while waiting for I/O
3. **Increased Throughput**: Multiple operations can be in progress simultaneously
4. **Scalability**: Can handle more concurrent operations with fewer resources

**Drawbacks:**
1. **Complexity**: Asynchronous code can be harder to understand and debug
2. **Error Handling**: Requires careful attention to error propagation
3. **Race Conditions**: Potential for timing-related bugs
4. **Callback Hell**: Without proper patterns, can lead to deeply nested callbacks

**Real-World Scenarios:**
- Database queries
- API calls to external services
- File operations
- Email sending
- Long-running computations

### 5. Circuit Breaker Pattern

**Status: ✅ Implemented**

**What is it?**  
The Circuit Breaker pattern is a stability pattern that prevents an application from repeatedly trying to execute an operation that's likely to fail. It works like an electrical circuit breaker, automatically "tripping" when a certain threshold of failures is reached, and then preventing further attempts for a specified period.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Three States**: CLOSED (normal operation), OPEN (failing, no attempts allowed), HALF-OPEN (testing if issue is resolved)
- **Failure Threshold**: Number of failures before the circuit opens
- **Timeout Period**: How long the circuit stays open before testing again
- **Fallback Mechanism**: Alternative behavior when the circuit is open
- **Monitoring**: Tracking circuit state and failure rates

**Implementation in SimpleEshop:**  
The Circuit Breaker pattern is implemented in `web-app/server/email-services/circuit-breaker.js`:

**Complete Implementation**:
```javascript
class CircuitBreaker {
    constructor(fn, options = {}) {
        this.fn = fn;
        this.failureThreshold = options.failureThreshold || 3;
        this.resetTimeout = options.resetTimeout || 30000; // 30 seconds
        this.state = 'CLOSED';
        this.failureCount = 0;
        this.nextAttempt = Date.now();
        this.name = options.name || 'Circuit';

        // For logging/monitoring
        this.successCount = 0;
        this.lastFailure = null;
        this.lastSuccess = null;
    }

    async fire(...args) {
        // Check if circuit is OPEN
        if (this.state === 'OPEN') {
            if (this.nextAttempt <= Date.now()) {
                logger.info(`${this.name}: Circuit is HALF-OPEN, allowing test request`);
                this.state = 'HALF-OPEN';
                metrics.updateCircuitBreakerMetrics(this.name, this.state);
            } else {
                const remainingTime = Math.round((this.nextAttempt - Date.now()) / 1000);
                logger.warn(`${this.name}: Circuit is OPEN, fast failing. Retry in ${remainingTime}s`);
                throw new Error(`Circuit is OPEN. Retry in ${remainingTime}s`);
            }
        }

        try {
            const result = await this.fn(...args);
            this.success();
            return result;
        } catch (error) {
            this.failure(error);
            throw error;
        }
    }

    success() {
        this.failureCount = 0;
        this.state = 'CLOSED';
        this.successCount++;
        this.lastSuccess = new Date();
        logger.info(`${this.name}: Operation succeeded, circuit CLOSED`);
        metrics.updateCircuitBreakerMetrics(this.name, this.state, true);
    }

    failure(error) {
        this.failureCount++;
        this.lastFailure = new Date();

        logger.warn(`${this.name}: Operation failed (${this.failureCount}/${this.failureThreshold}): ${error.message}`);
        metrics.updateCircuitBreakerMetrics(this.name, this.state, false);

        if (this.failureCount >= this.failureThreshold) {
            this.state = 'OPEN';
            this.nextAttempt = Date.now() + this.resetTimeout;
            const resetTime = new Date(this.nextAttempt).toISOString().substr(11, 8);
            logger.error(`${this.name}: Circuit OPENED until ${resetTime}`);
            metrics.updateCircuitBreakerMetrics(this.name, this.state);
        }
    }

    // Get current status for monitoring
    getStatus() {
        return {
            state: this.state,
            failureCount: this.failureCount,
            failureThreshold: this.failureThreshold,
            resetTimeout: this.resetTimeout,
            nextAttempt: this.state === 'OPEN' ? new Date(this.nextAttempt).toISOString() : null,
            successCount: this.successCount,
            lastFailure: this.lastFailure ? this.lastFailure.toISOString() : null,
            lastSuccess: this.lastSuccess ? this.lastSuccess.toISOString() : null
        };
    }
}
```

**Usage Example**:
```javascript
// Create a circuit breaker for email sending
const emailCircuitBreaker = new CircuitBreaker(
    async (mailOpts) => await transporter.sendMail(mailOpts),
    {
        failureThreshold: 3,
        resetTimeout: 30000,
        name: 'EmailCircuit'
    }
);

// Use the circuit breaker
try {
    const result = await emailCircuitBreaker.fire(mailOptions);
    console.log('Email sent successfully');
} catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to send email:', error.message);
    // Implement fallback behavior
}
```

**Testing**:
A comprehensive test script (`test-circuit-breaker.js`) is provided to demonstrate the Circuit Breaker Pattern in action:

```javascript
// In test-circuit-breaker.js
async function testWelcomeEmailCircuitBreaker() {
    // Test successful request
    // Simulate failures to trigger circuit breaker
    // Check circuit status after failures
    // Wait for reset and test again
}
```

**Benefits:**
1. **Prevents Cascading Failures**: Stops failures from propagating through the system
2. **Fail Fast**: Quickly rejects requests when a service is known to be unavailable
3. **Self-Healing**: Automatically tests if the service has recovered
4. **Resource Conservation**: Prevents wasting resources on operations likely to fail
5. **Improved User Experience**: Users get immediate feedback rather than waiting for timeouts

**Drawbacks:**
1. **Complexity**: Adds complexity to the codebase
2. **Configuration Challenges**: Determining appropriate thresholds and timeouts
3. **False Positives**: May open the circuit due to unrelated or temporary issues
4. **Testing Difficulty**: Circuit behavior depends on failure patterns

**Real-World Scenarios:**
- External API calls
- Database operations
- Email sending
- Payment processing
- Third-party service integration

## Recommended Additional Patterns

### 1. Idempotency Pattern

**Status: 🔄 Recommended**

**What is it?**  
The Idempotency pattern ensures that an operation can be repeated multiple times without causing unintended side effects beyond the first execution. This is crucial for distributed systems where operations might be retried due to network issues or other failures.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Idempotent Operations**: Operations that produce the same result regardless of how many times they're executed
- **Idempotency Keys**: Unique identifiers for operations to track previous executions
- **Request Deduplication**: Detecting and ignoring duplicate requests
- **Safe Retries**: Allowing clients to safely retry operations

**How to Implement in SimpleEshop:**
1. **Add Idempotency Keys to Critical Operations**:
   ```javascript
   app.post('/api/orders', async (req, res) => {
       const idempotencyKey = req.headers['idempotency-key'];
       if (!idempotencyKey) {
           return res.status(400).send('Idempotency-Key header is required');
       }

       // Check if this operation was already processed
       const existingOrder = await checkIdempotencyKey(idempotencyKey);
       if (existingOrder) {
           return res.status(200).json(existingOrder);
       }

       // Process the order
       const order = await processOrder(req.body);

       // Store the idempotency key with the result
       await storeIdempotencyResult(idempotencyKey, order);

       return res.status(201).json(order);
   });
   ```

2. **Implement Storage for Idempotency Keys**:
   ```javascript
   async function checkIdempotencyKey(key) {
       const query = 'SELECT result FROM idempotency_keys WHERE key = $1';
       const result = await pool.query(query, [key]);
       return result.rows.length > 0 ? JSON.parse(result.rows[0].result) : null;
   }

   async function storeIdempotencyResult(key, result) {
       const query = 'INSERT INTO idempotency_keys (key, result) VALUES ($1, $2) ON CONFLICT (key) DO NOTHING';
       await pool.query(query, [key, JSON.stringify(result)]);
   }
   ```

**Benefits:**
1. **Safe Retries**: Clients can safely retry operations without causing duplicates
2. **Improved Reliability**: Helps handle network issues and timeouts
3. **Simplified Error Handling**: Clients can use a simple retry strategy
4. **Consistency**: Prevents duplicate records or actions

**Real-World Scenarios:**
- Payment processing
- Order submission
- User registration
- Resource creation operations

### 2. Claim Check Pattern

**Status: 🔄 Recommended**

**What is it?**  
The Claim Check pattern is used to handle large messages in a messaging system. Instead of passing the entire message through the messaging system, a reference or "claim check" is passed, and the actual data is stored in an external repository.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Message Size Reduction**: Reduces the size of messages passed through the system
- **External Storage**: Stores large payloads in a separate repository
- **Claim Check**: A reference or token that can be used to retrieve the full message
- **Performance Optimization**: Improves messaging system performance

**How to Implement in SimpleEshop:**
1. **Store Large Payloads in MinIO**:
   ```javascript
   async function storeOrderData(order) {
       const bucketName = 'order-data';
       const objectName = `order-${order.id}-${Date.now()}.json`;
       const orderData = JSON.stringify(order);

       await minioClient.putObject(bucketName, objectName, orderData);

       return {
           bucketName,
           objectName
       };
   }
   ```

2. **Pass Claim Check in Notifications**:
   ```javascript
   app.post('/api/orders', async (req, res) => {
       // Process order
       const order = await processOrder(req.body);

       // Store order data in MinIO
       const claimCheck = await storeOrderData(order);

       // Send notification with claim check
       await sendOrderNotification({
           orderId: order.id,
           claimCheck
       });

       return res.status(201).json(order);
   });
   ```

3. **Retrieve Data Using Claim Check**:
   ```javascript
   async function processOrderNotification(notification) {
       const { orderId, claimCheck } = notification;

       // Retrieve order data using claim check
       const dataStream = await minioClient.getObject(claimCheck.bucketName, claimCheck.objectName);

       // Process the data
       let orderData = '';
       dataStream.on('data', chunk => {
           orderData += chunk.toString();
       });

       dataStream.on('end', async () => {
           const order = JSON.parse(orderData);
           // Process the order
       });
   }
   ```

**Benefits:**
1. **Reduced Message Size**: Improves messaging system performance
2. **Scalability**: Handles large payloads without overloading the messaging system
3. **Persistence**: Large data can be stored durably
4. **Separation of Concerns**: Messaging system focuses on delivery, not storage

**Real-World Scenarios:**
- Order processing with large item lists
- Image or file processing workflows
- Data export operations
- Report generation

### 3. Compensating Transaction Pattern

**Status: 🔄 Recommended**

**What is it?**  
The Compensating Transaction pattern is used to undo the effects of a series of steps when one step in a distributed transaction fails. Since distributed transactions often can't use traditional ACID transactions, this pattern provides a way to maintain consistency.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Saga Pattern**: A sequence of local transactions where each transaction updates data and publishes an event
- **Compensation Actions**: Operations that undo the effects of previous steps
- **Eventual Consistency**: The system may be temporarily inconsistent but will eventually reach a consistent state
- **Coordination**: Orchestrating the execution of compensating actions

**How to Implement in SimpleEshop:**
1. **Define Compensation Actions for Each Step**:
   ```javascript
   const orderSteps = {
       createOrder: {
           execute: async (data) => {
               // Create order
               return { orderId: 123 };
           },
           compensate: async (result) => {
               // Cancel order
               await cancelOrder(result.orderId);
           }
       },
       processPayment: {
           execute: async (data) => {
               // Process payment
               return { paymentId: 456 };
           },
           compensate: async (result) => {
               // Refund payment
               await refundPayment(result.paymentId);
           }
       },
       updateInventory: {
           execute: async (data) => {
               // Update inventory
               return { inventoryUpdates: [789] };
           },
           compensate: async (result) => {
               // Restore inventory
               await restoreInventory(result.inventoryUpdates);
           }
       }
   };
   ```

2. **Implement Saga Orchestrator**:
   ```javascript
   async function executeOrderSaga(orderData) {
       const stepResults = [];

       try {
           // Execute each step
           for (const [stepName, step] of Object.entries(orderSteps)) {
               const result = await step.execute(orderData);
               stepResults.push({ stepName, result });
           }

           return { success: true, results: stepResults };
       } catch (error) {
           // Execute compensation actions in reverse order
           for (let i = stepResults.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
               const { stepName, result } = stepResults[i];
               await orderSteps[stepName].compensate(result);
           }

           return { success: false, error: error.message };
       }
   }
   ```

**Benefits:**
1. **Consistency**: Maintains data consistency in distributed systems
2. **Failure Recovery**: Provides a mechanism to recover from failures
3. **Isolation**: Each step can be executed and compensated independently
4. **Auditability**: Creates a clear record of actions and compensations

**Real-World Scenarios:**
- Order processing with payment and inventory updates
- User registration with multiple services
- Multi-step workflows
- Cross-service operations

### 4. Async Reply Pattern

**Status: 🔄 Recommended**

**What is it?**  
The Async Reply pattern is used when a client makes a request that takes a long time to process. Instead of keeping the connection open, the server acknowledges the request and processes it asynchronously, then notifies the client when the processing is complete.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Request Acknowledgment**: Immediately acknowledge receipt of the request
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Process the request in the background
- **Correlation ID**: Unique identifier to correlate the request with the response
- **Notification Mechanism**: Method to inform the client when processing is complete

**How to Implement in SimpleEshop:**
1. **Implement Request Handler with Immediate Acknowledgment**:
   ```javascript
   app.post('/api/reports', async (req, res) => {
       const correlationId = generateCorrelationId();

       // Acknowledge the request immediately
       res.status(202).json({
           message: 'Report generation started',
           correlationId,
           statusUrl: `/api/reports/status/${correlationId}`
       });

       // Process the request asynchronously
       generateReportAsync(req.body, correlationId);
   });
   ```

2. **Implement Asynchronous Processing**:
   ```javascript
   async function generateReportAsync(reportData, correlationId) {
       try {
           // Update status to "processing"
           await updateReportStatus(correlationId, 'processing');

           // Generate the report (time-consuming operation)
           const report = await generateReport(reportData);

           // Store the report
           const reportUrl = await storeReport(report, correlationId);

           // Update status to "completed"
           await updateReportStatus(correlationId, 'completed', reportUrl);

           // Notify the client (e.g., via WebSocket, email, etc.)
           await notifyClient(correlationId, 'completed', reportUrl);
       } catch (error) {
           // Update status to "failed"
           await updateReportStatus(correlationId, 'failed', null, error.message);

           // Notify the client about the failure
           await notifyClient(correlationId, 'failed', null, error.message);
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Implement Status Endpoint**:
   ```javascript
   app.get('/api/reports/status/:correlationId', async (req, res) => {
       const { correlationId } = req.params;

       const status = await getReportStatus(correlationId);

       res.status(200).json(status);
   });
   ```

**Benefits:**
1. **Improved Responsiveness**: Client doesn't have to wait for long-running operations
2. **Resource Efficiency**: Doesn't keep connections open for long periods
3. **Better User Experience**: Users can continue working while the operation completes
4. **Scalability**: Can handle more concurrent requests

**Real-World Scenarios:**
- Report generation
- Data import/export operations
- Image or video processing
- Batch operations
- Long-running calculations
