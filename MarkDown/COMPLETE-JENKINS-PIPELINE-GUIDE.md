## Understanding CI/CD Pipelines

A CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) pipeline automates the process of building, testing, and deploying your application. For SimpleEshop, the pipeline will:

1. **Clone** your repository when changes are detected
2. **Build** your application
3. **Test** your code to ensure it works correctly
4. **Build** a Docker image
5. **Push** the Docker image to Docker Hub
6. **Update** the Kubernetes manifests in your GitOps repository
7. **Deploy** the application via ArgoCD (which monitors the GitOps repository)

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

1. Jenkins installed and running (accessible at http://<YOUR_CONTROL_PLANE_IP>:30080)
2. Docker Hub account
3. GitHub repository for your SimpleEshop project
4. ArgoCD installed and configured (accessible at https://<YOUR_CONTROL_PLANE_IP>:30443)
5. Access to your control plane VM

## Creating the Jenkinsfile

The Jenkinsfile defines the pipeline stages and steps. If you don't already have a Jenkinsfile in your repository, create one with the following content:

1. SSH into your control plane VM:
   ```bash
   ssh azureuser@<YOUR_CONTROL_PLANE_IP>
   ```

2. Clone your repository if you haven't already:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME>/SimpleEshop.git
   cd SimpleEshop
   ```

   3. Create a file named `Jenkinsfile` with the following content:
      ```groovy
         pipeline {
          agent any

          environment {
              DOCKER_IMAGE = '<YOUR_DOCKERHUB_USERNAME>/simpleeshop'
              DOCKER_TAG = "${BUILD_NUMBER}"
              DOCKERFILE_PATH = 'Dockerfile.x86'
              CONTROL_PLANE_IP = '<YOUR_CONTROL_PLANE_IP>'
              // Flag to track if this is a manual build
              MANUAL_TRIGGER = "${currentBuild.getBuildCauses().toString().contains('UserIdCause') ? 'true' : 'false'}"
          }

                              url: 'https://github.com/<YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME>/SimpleEshop.git',
                              branch: 'master'
                          sh 'ls -la Dockerfile.x86'

   - Specify the branch (e.g., "main")
   - Set the Script Path to "Jenkinsfile"
   - Click "Save"

## Configuring GitHub Integration

### Step 1: Configure Jenkins for Webhook Access

1. Go to "Manage Jenkins" > "Configure System"
2. Scroll down to the "GitHub" section
3. Click "Advanced" and check "Specify another hook URL for GitHub configuration"
4. Set the Hook URL to `http://<YOUR_CONTROL_PLANE_IP>:30080/github-webhook/`

2. Click on "Settings" > "Webhooks" > "Add webhook"
3. Set the Payload URL to `http://<YOUR_CONTROL_PLANE_IP>:30080/github-webhook/`
4. Set the Content type to `application/json`
5. For "Which events would you like to trigger this webhook?", select "Just the push event"
6. Check "Active"
7. Click "Add webhook"

## Setting Up Docker in Jenkins

For detailed instructions on setting up Docker in Jenkins, refer to the [JENKINS-DOCKER-SETUP.md](JENKINS-DOCKER-SETUP.md) guide. Here's a summary of the steps:

1. Install Docker CLI in the Jenkins container
2. Create a persistent volume for the Docker socket
3. Update the Jenkins deployment to mount the Docker socket
4. Set correct permissions for Docker access
5. Verify Docker access
6. Install the Docker Pipeline plugin
7. Configure Docker Hub credentials

## Running and Testing the Pipeline

### Step 1: Run Your First Pipeline Build

1. Go to your Jenkins dashboard
2. Click on your pipeline job (e.g., "SimpleEshop-WebApp")
3. Click "Build Now"
4. Monitor the build progress by clicking on the build number and then "Console Output"

### Step 2: Verify the Pipeline Results

After the pipeline completes:

1. Check that the Docker image was pushed to Docker Hub:
   - Go to https://hub.docker.com/r/<YOUR_DOCKERHUB_USERNAME>/simpleeshop/tags
   - Verify that a new tag with the build number exists

2. Check that the GitOps directory was updated:
   - Check the commit history of the main repository to see if a new commit was made by Jenkins to update the GitOps directory

3. Verify the deployment in ArgoCD:
   - Access ArgoCD at https://<YOUR_CONTROL_PLANE_IP>:30443
   - Log in with the admin credentials
   - Check the SimpleEshop application status
   - Verify that it's synced and healthy

### Step 3: Test Automatic Triggering

1. Make a change to a file in the web-app directory:
   ```bash
   # Edit a file in the web-app directory
   nano web-app/server/server_postgresql.js

   # Add a comment or make a small change

   # Commit and push the change
   git add web-app/server/server_postgresql.js
   git commit -m "Test web-app pipeline trigger"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. Go to your GitHub repository > "Settings" > "Webhooks"
3. Click on your webhook
4. Scroll down to "Recent Deliveries" to see if the webhook was delivered successfully
5. Check your Jenkins pipeline to see if it was triggered automatically

## Troubleshooting

### Pipeline Not Triggering

1. **Check Webhook Delivery**: In GitHub, go to your repository > "Settings" > "Webhooks" > click on your webhook > "Recent Deliveries" to see if there are any failed deliveries and why they failed.

2. **Check Jenkins Logs**: Go to "Manage Jenkins" > "System Log" to check for any errors related to webhook processing.

3. **Firewall Issues**: Ensure that port 30080 is open on your control plane VM and that GitHub can reach your Jenkins server.

4. **URL Issues**: Make sure the webhook URL is correct and includes the trailing slash: `http://<YOUR_CONTROL_PLANE_IP>:30080/github-webhook/`

### Docker Build Issues

1. **Docker Not Installed**: Verify that Docker is installed in the Jenkins container.

2. **Permission Issues**: Ensure that the Jenkins user has permission to use Docker.

3. **Docker Hub Rate Limiting**: If you encounter Docker Hub rate limiting, ensure you've configured Docker Hub credentials in Jenkins.

### Git Push Issues

1. **Credentials Issues**: Verify that the GitHub credentials are correct.

2. **Repository Access**: Ensure that the GitHub user has write access to the repository.

## Next Steps

Once you have your web app pipeline working, consider:

1. **Enhancing the pipeline for infrastructure changes**: Improve the existing Jenkinsfile to better handle changes to Kubernetes manifests, Terraform/Tofu files, and Ansible playbooks.

2. **Implementing more comprehensive testing**: Add unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests to your pipeline.

3. **Setting up notifications**: Configure Jenkins to send notifications (email, Slack, etc.) when builds succeed or fail.

4. **Implementing security scanning**: Add security scanning tools to your pipeline to identify vulnerabilities.

5. **Setting up monitoring**: Implement monitoring for your CI/CD pipeline to track build times, success rates, and other metrics.

## Conclusion

You have successfully set up a complete CI/CD pipeline for your SimpleEshop web application using Jenkins, GitHub, Docker, and ArgoCD. This pipeline automatically builds, tests, and deploys your application whenever changes are pushed to your GitHub repository.

This setup follows GitOps best practices, with Jenkins handling the CI part (building and testing) and ArgoCD handling the CD part (deployment to Kubernetes). The separation of concerns ensures that your deployment is always in sync with the desired state defined in your GitOps directory.
