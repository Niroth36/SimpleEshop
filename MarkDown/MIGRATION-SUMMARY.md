# Migration Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to the SimpleEshop application architecture.

## Migration from OpenWhisk to OpenFaaS (Previous)

Initially, the application was migrated from Apache OpenWhisk to OpenFaaS for serverless functionality.

## Migration from OpenFaaS to Standalone Service (Current)

The application has been further migrated from OpenFaaS to a standalone welcome-email service.

### Changes Made

#### 1. Docker Compose Configuration

- Removed OpenFaaS containers (gateway, faas-swarm, nats, prometheus)
- Added standalone welcome-email service container
- Updated port mappings and network configuration
- Fixed MinIO port configuration to use consistent ports

#### 2. Welcome Email Service

- Converted the OpenFaaS function to a standalone Node.js service
- Created Dockerfile.standalone for the welcome-email service
- Added direct MinIO event listening capability to the service
- Removed dependency on OpenFaaS for event processing

#### 3. Test Scripts

- Updated test-welcome-email.sh to test the standalone service
- Updated test-integration.sh to test MinIO → Welcome Email Service → Mailpit flow
- Removed test-openwhisk.sh and other OpenFaaS-specific tests
- Updated run-all-tests.sh to test the new architecture

#### 4. System Check and Documentation

- Updated check-system.sh to check for the welcome-email service instead of OpenFaaS
- Updated README.md with the new architecture diagram and description
- Updated README-TESTING.md with the new testing procedures
- Removed OpenFaaS-specific documentation

#### 5. Cleanup

- Removed all OpenFaaS-related files and configurations
- Removed OpenFaaS deployment scripts
- Removed OpenFaaS function configuration files

## Removal of OpenFaaS References (Current)

All references to OpenFaaS have been removed from the codebase:

1. Renamed the directory structure from `openfaas-functions` to `email-services`
2. Updated all references in docker-compose.yml to point to the new directory structure
3. Removed OpenFaaS references from package.json files
4. Updated comments and log messages to remove mentions of OpenFaaS
5. Updated bucket notification setup code to reference the email services directly

## Current Architecture

The current architecture uses standalone email services that listen for MinIO events directly:

1. When a user registers, their data is stored in PostgreSQL
2. The user data is also sent to MinIO as a JSON file in the user-registrations bucket
3. MinIO triggers the standalone welcome-email service via bucket notifications
4. The welcome-email service sends a welcome email to the user via Mailpit

## Testing the System

1. Start all services:
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

2. Check system status:
   ```bash
   ./check-system.sh
   ```

3. Run all tests:
   ```bash
   ./run-all-tests.sh
   ```

## Web Interfaces

- **Mailpit**: http://localhost:8025
- **MinIO Console**: http://localhost:9001
- **Welcome Email Service**: http://localhost:8080
- **Web App**: http://localhost:3000
