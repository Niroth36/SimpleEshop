# Resolving the "not in a git directory" Error in Jenkins Pipeline

## The Error

You're encountering the following error when running your Jenkins pipeline:

```
hudson.plugins.git.GitException: Command "git config remote.origin.url https://github.com/<YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME>/SimpleEshop.git" returned status code 128:
stdout: 
stderr: fatal: not in a git directory
```

## Why This Error Occurs

This error occurs because Jenkins is trying to execute a Git command (`git config remote.origin.url`) before the workspace has been properly initialized as a Git repository. 

When you use "Pipeline script from SCM" in Jenkins, it tries to:
1. First, set up the Git configuration for the repository
2. Then, clone the repository
3. Finally, execute the Jenkinsfile from the repository

The error happens in step 1, before the repository is even cloned. This is a common issue with the Jenkins Git plugin when it's trying to prepare the workspace for checkout.

## The Solution

The most effective solution is to change your pipeline configuration from "Pipeline script from SCM" to "Pipeline script" and manually handle the repository checkout within the script. This approach gives you more control over how and when the Git operations are performed.

### Steps to Implement the Solution:

1. Go to your Jenkins job
2. Click "Configure"
3. Under "Pipeline", change from "Pipeline script from SCM" to "Pipeline script"
4. Paste the following script:

```groovy
node {
    // Checkout the repository
    checkout([
        $class: 'GitSCM',
        branches: [[name: '*/main']],
        doGenerateSubmoduleConfigurations: false,
        extensions: [],
        submoduleCfg: [],
        userRemoteConfigs: [[
            url: 'https://github.com/<YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME>/SimpleEshop.git',
            credentialsId: 'github-credentials'  // Use your GitHub credentials ID
        ]]
    ])

    // Load and execute the Jenkinsfile from the repository
    def jenkinsfile = load 'Jenkinsfile'
}
```

5. Replace the repository URL and branch name with your own
6. Replace 'github-credentials' with your GitHub credentials ID
7. Click "Save"
8. Run the pipeline again

## Why This Solution Works

This solution works because:

1. It bypasses the automatic Git configuration that Jenkins tries to do before cloning the repository
2. It explicitly defines how to check out the repository using the `checkout` step
3. It then loads and executes the Jenkinsfile from the checked-out repository

By manually controlling the checkout process, you avoid the situation where Jenkins tries to run Git commands in a directory that isn't yet a Git repository.

## Alternative Solutions

If you prefer to keep using "Pipeline script from SCM", you can try these alternatives:

1. **Check out to a sub-directory**: Add the "Check out to a sub-directory" behavior in the Git configuration
2. **Update the Git plugin**: Make sure your Git plugin is up to date
3. **Clean the workspace**: Enable "Delete workspace before build starts" in the job configuration
4. **Check permissions**: Ensure the Jenkins user has the necessary permissions to create and modify Git repositories

However, the "Pipeline script" approach is generally the most reliable solution for this specific error.

## Conclusion

The "not in a git directory" error is a common issue with Jenkins pipelines that use Git. By switching to a "Pipeline script" approach and manually handling the repository checkout, you can avoid this error and ensure your pipeline runs smoothly.

After implementing this solution, your pipeline should be able to properly check out the repository and execute the Jenkinsfile without encountering the "not in a git directory" error.
